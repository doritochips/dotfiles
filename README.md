## Larry Lv Dot Files

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

Most of it is based on Ryan Bates dot files, who Iâ€™m really thankful. You can see more information here: github.com/ryanb/dotfiles

### Installation

```
git clone git://github.com/LarryLv/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
